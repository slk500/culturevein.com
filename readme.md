The site is a community-annotated library of music videos on YouTube, tagged by subject matter.


Tagging means describing the content with relevant keywords.
The tag may be an action, a scene, a person, a word or phrase, an object, a gesture, or a clich√© or trope.

Right now as a part of experiment I'm trying to remove OOP objects & use only functions.

To run project:
1. docker-compose up
2. composer install
3. npm install

* To Do List
    * Add new tag time, if already exist and is red - delete before add new
    * TODO Check if all YT links works
    * TODO script to download all music videos from precise tag, cut only the tag scenes, glue them in one video  
    * TODO Mailing
        * TODO notification of tags subscription
        * TODO notification of changes to your tags 
        * TODO notifications of changes to video that you added
